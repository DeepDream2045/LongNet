### DilatedAttention

DilatedAttention is a module that performs dilated attention on input tensors.

#### Systems Understanding

The DilatedAttention module takes an input tensor of shape (batch_size, sequence_length, d_model) and applies dilated attention to the input. The attention mechanism consists of multiple attention heads with different dilation rates. Each attention head operates on a subset of the input tensor determined by the dilation rate and segment size. The outputs of the attention heads are weighted and combined to produce the final output tensor.

The input tensor is first passed through the positional encoding layer, which adds positional information to the input. Then, for each attention head, the input tensor is divided into segments based on the dilation rate. Each segment is fed into a FlashMHA (Flash Multi-Head Attention) module, which performs self-attention on the segment. The attention outputs from each segment are concatenated and form the output of the attention head. If relative positional bias is enabled, the relative positional bias is added to the attention outputs. If casual attention is enabled, a mask is applied to the attention outputs to prevent attending to future positions. The attention outputs are then multiplied by weights corresponding to the dilation rates and combined to form the final output tensor.

#### Usage example

```python
import torch
from LongNet import DilatedAttention

# Create a DilatedAttention module
dilated_attention = DilatedAttention(d_model=512, num_heads=8, dilation_rate=2, segment_size=16)

# Generate random input tensor
batch_size = 4
sequence_length = 32
d_model = 512
input_tensor = torch.randn(batch_size, sequence_length, d_model)

# Apply dilated attention to the input tensor
output_tensor = dilated_attention(input_tensor)

# Print the shape of the output tensor
print(output_tensor.shape)
```
